PLUG is a Linux user group based in Philadelphia, PA that was formed in 1995. We have two meetings a month: PLUG Central meets on the first Wednesday of the month, and PLUG North meets on the second Tuesday of the month. Traditionally these met in the city and the northern suburbs, respectively, but moved online in 2020 with the pandemic. We also have an active mailing list.
