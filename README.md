## Linux.org LUG Directory

This is meant to mirror the  [LUG directory](https://www.bclug.org/) on Linux.org.  I try to keep it up to date, but for best results, please visit the site.

Feel free to create a pull request against this repo and I'll approve it, then add it to the directory on the site for you.

You will want to follow the `sample.md` to match the others as well as likely create a directory tree down to your location starting with Country, then State / Province.
